# Composite-Characters-in-Nepali(C#)
Composite characters (संयुक्त अक्षर) in a word consist of two or more consonants combined with a vowel. They are essential when working with various tools like font conversion (TTF to Unicode and vice versa), spell checking, and text justification. These characters play a crucial role in maintaining character semantics during such processes.
- For example: a Word "राष्ट्रियताले" consists of "रा ष्ट्रि य ता ले" composite characters.
  
This work uses state-machine based approach to solve this problem and implemented in C# for MSWord plugin.
